# Flask Chat Messenger â€“ Tutorial Implementation

This repository contains my personal implementation of a **Flask Chat Messenger**, following the [YouTube tutorial by Programmieren lernen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9u_vm9aAmM). In my opinion the project is a great way to learn about building web applications with Flask, including routing, templates, and handling real-time communication.
