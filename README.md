# Flask Chat Messenger – Tutorial Implementation

This repository contains my personal implementation of a **Flask Chat Messenger**, following the [YouTube tutorial by Programmieren lernen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9u_vm9aAmM). In my opinion the project is a great way to learn about building web applications with Flask, including routing, templates, and handling real-time communication. The main point of getting a 

## 📄 **Project Overview**

This chat messenger application is built using **Flask**, with a focus on learning the following concepts:
- Setting up a basic Flask application.
- Creating routes and views.
- Using **HTML** and **CSS** for the frontend.
- Handling real-time updates and messaging.
- Managing user sessions.

## 🔍 **Motivation**
This project serves as a hands-on exercise to learn Flask and real-time web development. The primary motivation is to gain experience with Flask, which I plan to use in a future project: a lightweight Machine Learning experiment tracking tool [MiniML](https://github.com/JSchierling1/MiniML) (similar to ClearML) that will help visualize and compare ML experiments for the Project of my Bachelor Thesis.

By working through this chat messenger tutorial, I aim to:

Understand how Flask handles routes, requests, and responses.
Learn how to build and structure a Flask application.
Gain experience with front-end and back-end communication.
Apply the knowledge in my upcoming MiniML project.

## 🛠 **Technologies Used**

- **Backend:** Flask (Python)  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
