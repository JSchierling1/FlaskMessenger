# Flask Chat Messenger â€“ Tutorial Implementation

This repository contains my personal implementation of a **Flask Chat Messenger**, following the [YouTube tutorial by Tech With Tim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9u_vm9aAmM). The project is a great way to learn about building web applications with Flask, including routing, templates, and handling real-time communication.

## ðŸ“„ **Project Overview**

This chat messenger application is built using **Flask**, with a focus on learning the following concepts:
- Setting up a basic Flask application.
- Creating routes and views.
- Using **HTML** and **CSS** for the frontend.
- Handling real-time updates and messaging.
- Managing user sessions.

## ðŸ›  **Technologies Used**

- **Backend:** Flask (Python)  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Additional Libraries:** Flask-SocketIO for real-time communication

## ðŸš€ **How to Run the Project**

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd flask-chat-messenger
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the Flask application:
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```
5. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:5000` to view the chat messenger.
